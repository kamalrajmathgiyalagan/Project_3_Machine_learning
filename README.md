# Project_3_Machine_learning
EcoType is a machine learning project that predicts forest cover types in a given geographical area using environmental features such as elevation, slope, soil type, and wilderness area. The project aims to support forestry management, environmental monitoring, and land-use planning through automated and reliable cover type classification.
